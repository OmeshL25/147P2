JavaDocs are used in the project to create professional, easy-to-read documentation directly from Java source code comments. By adding structured JavaDoc comments, developers can generate HTML documentation that explains classes, methods, and parameters. Once generated, the documentation can be viewed locally through index.html or published online using GitHub Pages by setting the source folder to /docs in the repository’s settings. This makes the documentation accessible via a live URL, improving collaboration, transparency, and understanding of the project.
